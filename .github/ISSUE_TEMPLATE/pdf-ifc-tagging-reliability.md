# PDF/IFC Tagging Reliability Tests - Tracking Issue

## Overview
This tracking issue covers the implementation of comprehensive reliability tests for PDF and IFC file tagging functionality across the InstallSure platform and related viewer applications.

**Priority:** High  
**Areas:** Viewer, Estimator  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Started

---

## Context

The InstallSure application supports multiple BIM file formats including:
- **IFC** (Industry Foundation Classes) - `.ifc`
- **DWG** (AutoCAD Drawing) - `.dwg`
- **RVT** (Revit) - `.rvt`
- **STEP** - `.step`
- **OBJ** - `.obj`
- **GLTF/GLB** - `.gltf`, `.glb`

Current implementation:
- File upload handling in `applications/installsure/backend/src/routes/files.ts`
- PDF.js integration in multiple applications (`pdfjs.js` client integrations)
- File size limit: 100MB
- Storage: Local + S3 compatible

**Current Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No reliability tests for file tagging
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown behavior with malformed IFC files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PDF parsing edge cases not tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large file handling not validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concurrent upload scenarios untested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Metadata extraction reliability unknown
