## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from LinkedIn?**
A: Hello is focused on instant, in-person networking. It's the digital equivalent of exchanging business cards, not a social network.

**Q: Is it free?**
A: Yes, completely free to use. No subscriptions or hidden costs.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Your card can be viewed offline. Sending/receiving requests requires internet.

**Q: How do you prevent spam?**
A: Request-based system. Users must accept connection requests, and duplicate requests are prevented.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: Only public profile information is shared. Users control what they display.

**Q: Can I use my own domain?**
A: Yes, the app can be deployed to any custom domain.

**Q: Is it production-ready?**
A: The core features work. Production deployment would need security hardening (proper JWT, rate limiting, etc.).

**Q: Mobile app plans?**
A: Currently a progressive web app (PWA). Native apps could be added using React Native.
